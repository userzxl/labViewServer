<h4>2. Required Software</h4>
<para>Some software components need to be installed before using this
instrument driver. <br>The minimum versions of these components are listed
below, and can be downloaded from the Download Site.
<br>
<br>
VISA 4.0 or later<br><br>
<i>Note: VISA has additional software requirements. <br>For example, unless you are using a serial interface, 
NI-VISA requires that NI-488.2 and/or NI-VXI be installed on your system. <br>Check with VISA help for additional 
support software and hardware requirements.</i>

<br><br>

<b>3. Installation Instructions</b><br><br>
LabVIEW:<br>
Instrument drivers should be installed as a subdirectory of the LabVIEW\instr.lib.<br>
The Fluke 884X Series instrument driver is installed in the following directory:  LabVIEW\instr.lib\Fluke 884X Series<br>

<h4>4. Using the Instrument Driver</h4>
<para>LabVIEW:
To verify communication with your instrument and test a typical programmatic instrument operation, you should 
first open the Getting Started or Example VIs the instrument driver. Look over each of the controls and set 
them appropriately. Generally, with the exception of the address field, the defaults for most controls will 
be sufficient for your first run. You will need to set the instrument resource name appropriately. After 
running the VI, check to see that reasonable data was returned and an error was not reported in the error 
cluster.

After you have verified basic communication with your instrument, you might want to customize instrument 
control for your needs. If your application needs are similar to the Getting Started or Example VI, the 
simplest means of creating a customized VI is to save a copy of the Getting Started or Example VI by 
selecting Save As from the File menu. You can then modify this example to meet your specific needs.

For more details, reference the <i>LabVIEW Help</i> under <i>Help&raquo;VI, Function, & How-To Help.</i></para>

<h4>5. Known Issues</h4>
<para>
To report issues or provide feedback about this instrument driver, please send an email to <a href="mailto:instrument.drivers@ni.com">instrument.drivers@ni.com</a>.<br><br>

1.When aborting a VI through LabVIEW while instrument is acquiring data or running an example with a large sample size and a small<br> 
 timeout that causes a timeout and then trying to run the example again or trying to run another example<br> an ID Query failed error is generated.  
To clear this error run Device Clear.vi. and or wait a few seconds while the instrument complete acquiring data.
<br><br>
2. Ethernet interface is not VXI-11 Compliant therefore not currently supported.
